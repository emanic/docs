== `api` command

The `api` command allows you to issue raw Segment Console API requests.

=== `all` subcommand

The `all` subcommand prints the list of all existing Segment Console API
resources handled by `apoctl`. It prints them in one line as it is
mainly used for auto-completion.

Example:

....
apoctl api all
....

To get one resource per line, you can do:

....
apoctl api all | tr ' ' '\n'
....
