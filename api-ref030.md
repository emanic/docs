### ClaimMapping

Allows you to map a claim in a token to an HTTP header. This can be useful
when offloading authentication and authorization to Aporeto. Some applications
may expect to receive information in the HTTP header.

  "targetHTTPHeader": "X-Username"
}

(JWT)
in HTTP requests. This is an optional field, needed only if the
`authorizationType`
is set to `JWT`.

##### `MTLSCertificateAuthority` `string`

PEM-encoded certificate authority to use to verify client certificates. This
only applies
if `authorizationType` is set to `MTLS`. If it is not set, Aporeto's public
signing
certificate authority will be used.

##### `OIDCCallbackURL` `string`

This is an advanced setting. Optional OIDC callback URL. If you don't set it,
Aporeto will autodiscover it. It will be
`https://<hosts[0]|IPs[0]>/aporeto/oidc/callback`.

and
required if `TLSType` is set to `External`.

##### `TLSType` `enum(Aporeto | LetsEncrypt | External | None)`

Set how to provide a server certificate to the service.

- `Aporeto`: Generate a certificate issued from Aporeto public CA.
- `LetsEncrypt`: Issue a certificate from Let's Encrypt.
- `External`: : Let you define your own certificate and key to use.
- `None`: : TLS is disabled (not recommended).

Default value:

```json
"Aporeto"
```

Defines the user authorization type that should be used.

- `None` (default): No authorization.
- `JWT`:  Configures a simple JWT verification from the HTTP `Authorization`
header.
- `OIDC`: Configures OIDC authorization. You must then set
`OIDCClientID`,`OIDCClientSecret`, `OIDCProviderURL`.
- `MTLS`: Configures client certificate authorization. Then you can optionally
use `MTLSCertificateAuthority`, otherwise Aporeto's public signing certificate
will be used.

Default value:

```json
"None"
```

##### `claimsToHTTPHeaderMappings` [`[]claimmapping`](#claimmapping)

Defines a list of mappings between claims and HTTP headers. When these mappings
are defined,
the enforcer will copy the values of the claims to the corresponding HTTP
headers.

##### `createTime` `time` [`autogenerated`,`read_only`]

Creation date of the object.

##### `description` `string` [`max_length=1024`]

Description of the object.

##### `disabled` `boolean`

Defines if the property is disabled.

##### `endpoints` [`[]endpoint`](#endpoint) [`read_only`]

Resolves the API endpoints that the service is exposing. Only valid during
policy rendering.

##### `exposedAPIs` `[][]string`

Contains a tag expression that will determine which APIs a service is exposing.
The APIs can be defined as the `RESTAPISpec` or similar specifications for other
layer 7 protocols.

##### `exposedPort` `integer` [`required`,`max_value=65535.000000`]

The port that the service can be accessed on. Note that this is different from
the
`port` attribute that describes the port that the service is actually listening
on.
For example if a load balancer is used, the `exposedPort` is the port that the
load
balancer is listening for the service, whereas the port that the implementation
is
listening can be different.

##### `exposedServiceIsTLS` `boolean`

Indicates that the exposed service is TLS. This means that the enforcer has to
initiate a
TLS session in order to forward traffic to the service.

Default value:

```json
false
```

##### `external` `boolean`

Indicates if this is an external service.

Default value:

```json
false
```

##### `hosts` `[]string`

The host names that the service can be accessed on.

##### `metadata` `[]string` [`creation_only`]

Contains tags that can only be set during creation, must all start
with the '@' prefix, and should only be used by external systems.

Name of the entity.

##### `namespace` `string` [`autogenerated`,`read_only`]

Namespace tag attached to an entity.

##### `normalizedTags` `[]string` [`autogenerated`,`read_only`]

Contains the list of normalized tags of the entities.

##### `port` `integer` [`max_value=65535.000000`]

The port that the implementation of the service is listening to. It can be
different than
`exposedPort`. This is needed for port mapping use cases where there are private
and
public ports.

##### `protected` `boolean`

Defines if the object is protected.

##### `publicApplicationPort` `integer` [`max_value=65535.000000`]

A new virtual port that the service can be accessed on, using HTTPS. Since the
enforcer
transparently inserts TLS in the application path, you might want to declare a
new port
where the enforcer listens for TLS. However, the application does not need to be
modified
and the enforcer will map the traffic to the correct application port. This
useful when
an application is being accessed from a public network.

##### `redirectURLOnAuthorizationFailure` `string`

If this is set, the user will be redirected to that URL in case of any
authorization
failure, allowing you to provide a nice message to the user. The query parameter
`?failure_message=<message>` will be added to that URL explaining the possible
reasons
of the failure.

##### `selectors` `[][]string`

A tag or tag expression that identifies the processing unit that implements this
particular service.

##### `trustedCertificateAuthorities` `string`

PEM-encoded certificate authorities to trust when additional hops are needed. It
must be
set if the service must reach a service marked as `external` or must go through
an
additional TLS termination point like a layer 7 load balancer.

##### `type` `enum(HTTP | TCP | KubernetesSecrets | VaultSecrets)`

Type of service.

Default value:

```json
"HTTP"
```

##### `updateTime` `time` [`autogenerated`,`read_only`]
