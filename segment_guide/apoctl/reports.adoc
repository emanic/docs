== `reports` command

The `reports` command enables the generation of various reports based on
the Segment Console data. Currently it only supports one report type:
`compliance`.

Examples:

....
apoctl reports compliance --selector \$identity=processingunit --selector type=aporeto --format=csv
....

=== `compliance` subcommand

The `compliance` subcommand allows you to create simple compliance
reports based on the policies associated with a namespace. The report
can be exported either as a table or in CSV format.

You must provide a list of tag selectors that will select the processing
units for which the compliance report must be run. The default output
format is a table.

Examples:

....
apoctl reports compliance --selector \$identity=processingunit --selector type=aporeto --format=csv
....
