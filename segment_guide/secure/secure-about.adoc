== About network policies

Network policies allow you to control layer 3 and 4 traffic between:

* Processing units
* Processing units and external networks

External networks represent hosts _without_ an defender. Processing
units represent units of computation on hosts _with_ defenders.

Because external networks represent hosts without defenders, you canâ€™t
control their attempts to initiate or accept connections. However, you
can control whether processing units:

* Initiate connections to external networks.
* Accept connections from external networks.

The *Platform* pane of Segment Console represents external networks with
boxes and processing units with octagons.

The above example shows that a `malicious-ips` external network
attempted to connect to the `sleepy-sammet` processing unit, which
represents a Docker nginx image. Aporeto enforced a network policy and
blocked the attempt.

You can also use external networks to control access to AWS S3 buckets
and RDS instances.

Segment provides automations and recipes to make defining external
networks easier.

This section contains step-by-step instructions for common network
policy use cases.
