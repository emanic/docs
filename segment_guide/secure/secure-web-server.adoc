=== About allowing access to web servers

Because Segment denies layer 3 and 4 traffic by default, after you
install a Segment defender on the host of a web server, the web server
begins to reject all incoming connections. Users attempting to access
the web server receive time out messages.

The view from the *Platform* pane of the Segment Cosole web interface
looks something like this.

When you click on the red line and select the *Policies* tab, you will
see that the traffic is denied due to the *Aporeto default reject all*
policy.

This section describes how to allow incoming layer 3 and 4 traffic to
web servers.

=== Prerequisites

* `apoctl` installed
* An `APOCTL_NAMESPACE` environment variable set to the namespace of the
web server’s processing unit
* Authenticated to `apoctl` with the *Namespace Administrator* role

=== Creating an external network

The following command creates an external network representing TCP
connections on port 80 and 443 from any IP address. It names the
external network `internet` and assigns it a tag of `ext:name=internet`.

[source,console]
----
cat <<EOF | apoctl api create externalnetwork -f -
name: internet
entries:
- 0.0.0.0/0
protocols:
- tcp
ports:
- "80"
- "443"
associatedTags:
- ext:name=internet
EOF
----

You may need to modify the `ports` values to match those that your web
server listens on. If there is a load balancer or a Kubernetes service
fronting the web server, specify its port.

If you’re not sure, go ahead and create the external network using the
above definition. You can edit it later.

=== Selecting the web server

Identify a tag or set of tags that allow you to uniquely identify the
web server or group of web servers. It may help to open up the Segment
Console web interface and review the tags of the processing units that
represent the web servers.

Segment supports logical tag expressions, allowing you to link tags with
ANDs and ORs. You may be able to come up with a tag expression that
selects the web servers using the tags that they already have.
Alternatively, you may want to add tags to the web servers to make it
easier to select them.

Once you have determined the tag or tags, set an environment variable to
contain each tag. We add four below.

[source,console]
----
export WEBSERVER="pu:type=web-server"
export PROD="pu:state=prod"
export DEV="pu:state=dev"
export PU="\$identity=processingunit"
----

Because these values are stored as environment variables, you must
escape any bash control characters. In the example above, we escape the
`$` bash control character by adding `\` in front of it.

=== Creating a network policy to accept connections

Next, use one of the following commands to create a network policy that
accepts incoming requests from the external network you just defined. We
provide three examples below to show how to work with a single tag as
well as multiple tags with both AND and OR relationships.

* *Single tag*
+
[source,console]
----
cat <<EOF | apoctl api create networkaccesspolicy -f -
name: allow-web-server
action: Allow
applyPolicyMode: IncomingTraffic
propagate: true
logsEnabled: true
subject:
- - ext:name=internet
object:
- - "$WEBSERVER"
EOF
----
* *Tags with AND relationship*
+
[source,console]
----
cat <<EOF | apoctl api create networkaccesspolicy -f -
name: allow-web-server
action: Allow
applyPolicyMode: IncomingTraffic
propagate: true
logsEnabled: true
subject:
- - ext:name=internet
object:
- - "$WEBSERVER"
  - "$PU"
EOF
----
* *Tags with OR relationship*
+
[source,console]
----
cat <<EOF | apoctl api create networkaccesspolicy -f -
name: allow-web-server
action: Allow
applyPolicyMode: IncomingTraffic
propagate: true
logsEnabled: true
subject:
- - ext:name=internet
object:
- - "$WEBSERVER"
  - "$PU"
  - "$PROD"
- - "$WEBSERVER"
  - "$PU"
  - "$DEV"
EOF
----

Observe how the hyphens allow you to specify AND and OR relationships
between the tags.

=== Verifying that the web server accepts incoming connections

Open a browser and paste in the IP address or domain name of your web
server. In the Segment Console web interface, you should see a green
flow as shown below.

image::net-pol-web-server-allow.png[web-server-allowing-incoming-requests]

If your request instead times out and you don’t see the *internet*
external network with a green flow, adjust your external network and
network policy definitions as needed.

=== Next steps

If your web server is public, you are done!

If you want to allow only certain people to access the web server, you
can configure Segment to authenticate your users against an OpenID
Connect (OIDC) identity provider.
