== Autoscale nodes and pods

If you have deployed Segment Console across multiple nodes, you can use
Kubernetes to automatically scale your pods and nodes.

You must put Segment Console in maintenance mode before enabling the
following.

* *Pod auto scaling*: when enabled,
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/[pod
auto scaling] will define `hpa` resources to scale the number of
replicas depending on certain metrics. Note that your Kubernetes cluster
needs to have a `metrics-server` installed.
* *Cluster auto scaling*: depending on your Kubernetes provider, you may
enable
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-management/#cluster-autoscaling[cluster
auto scaling].

If you have deployed Segment Console in a single container, you cannot
scale your nodes and pods.
