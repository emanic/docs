== Authorization

=== Basics

Once Segment Console knows the identity of the caller, it will check the
API authorizations to decide if the user is allowed to perform the
operation or not.

API authorizations use a tag expression that is based on the claimâ€™s
`data` field as a subject to assign roles to the caller. Roles contain a
list of allowed resources and operations.

For instance, the role `Namespace Administrator` gives full read/write
permissions on a namespace while the role `Enforcer` only gives
permissions necessary for a Defender to work properly.

Reusing the above examples it is possible to create the following API
authorizations. As you can see below, the content of the tags in the
subject field are coming from the `data` section of the JWT. They must
be converted to `@auth:<lower-case-key>=<value>` to avoid any confusion
with other tags.

=== Make the Aporeto company account administrator a namespace administrator

The following API authorization makes the user, coming with a token for
the account ``company'', an administrator on the namespace
`/mynamespace` and all the child namespaces.

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|===
|field |description
|subject |`@auth:realm=vince` and `@auth:account=company`
|object |`@auth:role=namespace.administrator`
|namespace |`/acme`
|propagate |`true`
|===

`@auth:realm=vince` indicates that the token is coming from an Aporeto
account.

=== Make the AWS security token bearer a Defender

The following API authorization makes the user, coming with a token from
AWS that has the role `segment`, a Defender on the namespace
`/acme/app/gitlab` only.

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|===
|field |description
|subject |`@auth:realm=awssecuritytoken` and `@auth:rolename=segment`
|object |`@auth:role=enforcer`
|namespace |`/acme/app/gitlab`
