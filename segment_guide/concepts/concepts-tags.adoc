== Tags and identity

=== Basics

In order to understand how Segment secures your system, you have to
understand how it handles object identity. The identity of an object is
established by a set of tags and a tag is a key-value pair that
describes an attribute of an object.

For example:

* `app=wordpress`
* `role=frontend`
* `env=qa`
* `os=linux`
* `$type=docker`

Tags are consumed from different sources like the computing environment,
the application, or Segment Console itself. Other tags can be added
manually using the Segment Console web interface, from the command line
with `apoctl`, or a Segment Console API call. This powerful tag-based
identity is used to define network policies and API authorizations in
Segment.

=== Types of tags

Tag names are categorized and prefixed based on their origin.

[width="100%",cols="<10%,<67%,<23%",options="header",]
|===
|Prefix |Description |Example
|`$` |*Attribute based tag*: auto-generated, based on object attributes.
|`$name=nginx`

|`@` |*Metadata Tag*: can only be added at the creation.
|`@sys:image=nginx`

|`@auth` |*Auth Tag*: derived from an auth token claim
|`@auth:account=mycompany`

| |*User Defined*: defined by a user |`role=frontend`

=== Tag expressions

You can link tags together with `AND` or `OR` operators to form tag
expressions.

For example, you can create an expression like:

[source,bash]
----
(size=big and color=blue) or (size=small and color=red) or (type=admin)
----

Segment represents this information in a two-dimensional array, where:

* The first dimension is `OR`s
* The second dimension is `AND`s

The above expression is then represented by:

[source,json]
----
[
  ["size=big", "color=blue"],
  ["size=small", "color=red"],
  ["type=admin"],
]
----

The web interface provides graphical controls to help you build these
expressions easily.

=== Best practices

It may be tempting to add a large number of tags, but in reality,
remember the adage ``less is more.'' In the end, adding a large number
of tags may be more confusing than it is helpful.

For example, if you deploy a three-tier application, you may only need:

* `app=myapp`
* `role=frontend`, `role=backend`, `role=database`
* `env=production`

In turn, you can create a network policy that will allow:

* allow from `app=myapp and role=frontend and env=production` to
`app=myapp and role=backend and env=production`
* allow from `app=myapp and role=backend and env=production` to
`app=myapp and role=database and env=production`
