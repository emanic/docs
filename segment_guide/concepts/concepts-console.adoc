== Segment Console

Segment Console is a microservice application designed for scale. It
manages all Segment resources. You can access it from three interfaces.

* *Web interface*: a web application accessed through your browser that
allows you to define all resources, as well as view a visual
representation of all applications that are protected by Segment. All
possible actions in the web interface may be alternatively performed by
scripts instead.
* *Command line*: `apoctl` is the Segment command line interface (CLI).
It supports completion as well as various other commands that will help
you automate everything in Segment.
* *REST API*: the Segment Console API allows programmatic manipulation
of all parts of the system. Both the web interface and `apoctl` act as
clients of the Segment Console API.
