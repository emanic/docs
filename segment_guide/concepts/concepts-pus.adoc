== Processing units

A processing unit represents a unit of computation which the Defender
will protect by applying network policies. It can be:

* A container
* A Kubernetes pod
* A Linux process
* An entire host
* Specific services (protocol/port pairs) in a Linux host

The Defender reports the processing units and the network interactions
it protects to Segment Console so you can visualize your application
flows.

It will apply default tags to the processing units according to what it
finds. For example, a container will be tagged with the image name, a
process with its PID, a host with its hostname, a pod with its
namespace, and so on. This set of predictable tags can be used to write
network policies.
