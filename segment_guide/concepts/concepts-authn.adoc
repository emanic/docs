== Authentication

Authentication is the process or action of verifying the identity of a
user or process. For example, it might be seen as an ID card claiming
who the caller is to a system.

Segment Console authentication is based on
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[JSON Web Tokens (JWT)]. JWTs are an
open, industry standard method for representing claims securely between
two parties. These tokens are issued by Segment Console as long as it
can verify the provenance. The token is used with almost all API
requests to Segment Console.
