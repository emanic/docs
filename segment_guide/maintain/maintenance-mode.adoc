== Maintenance mode

=== Enabling maintenance mode

For certain operations like scaling, you may want to put Segment Console
in maintenance mode. To enable maintenance mode, issue the following
command from within an activated Voila environment.

[source,console]
----
# the maintenance command
maintenance
----

It should return the following message.

[source,console]
----
!!! You will put the control plane in maintenance mode. Service API https://segment.acme.com will be interrupted until this script ends. !!!

> Give a reason for maintenance (mandatory and will be logged): Test
Service API https://segment.acme.com in maintenance mode (reason: Test).
Redirecting API service to maintenance page... (please wait) Ok

#############################
#  MAINTENANCE MODE ENABLED #
#    SERVICE IS SUSPENDED   #
#############################

Relaunch maintenance tool to stop the maintenance mode.
----

At this point the Segment Console is in maintenance mode.

=== During maintenance mode

In maintenance mode, Segment Console ceases to serve the Segment Console
API. Clients of the Segment Console API return the following messages.

* `apoctl` command line client

[source,console]
----
apoctl api list namespaces
error: Cannot communicate: The api has been locked down by the server.
----

* Segment Console API

[source,json]
----
curl -k https://segment.acme.com
[{"title":"Service Locked","description":"The requested service is in maintenance. Please try again in a moment.","code":423,"subject":"wutai"}]%
----

* Segment Console web interface

The web interface will keep trying to reach the Segment Console API.

=== Disabling maintenance mode

Once you are done just run the `maintenance` command again. It returns
the following.

[source,console]
----
Your platform is currently in maintenance mode
Do you want to restore the service (y/n): y
Service restored, maintenance took 1min.
----

Segment Console has been restored.
