== Back up

=== Enabling backups

The `voila` installer container comes with a set of tools including some
for backup/restore:

* `backup`: This is a tool to trigger backup operation on InfluxDB and
MongoDB databases.
* `restore`: This is a tool to perform backup restore operation on
InfluxDB and MongoDB databases.

If you did not enable backups when you created your Voila environment,
use the following command to enable them.

[source,console]
----
set_value global.backup.enabled true override
----

Then run `doit` to deploy the backup jobs.

The backup job schedule can be changed with:

* `set_value backup.schedule " 0 0 * * *" mongodb-backup override`
* `set_value backup.schedule " 0 0 * * *" influxdb-backup override`

=== Triggering backups

The `backup` tool allows you to trigger a backup whenever you want. Just
type `backup` and follow the prompts.

=== Restoring a database

The `restore` tool allows you to restore a database using previous
backup and allows you to perform four kinds of actions:

* Restore from a backup
* Enter the container for advanced backup actions
* Push files from your machine to the backup container
* Fetch files from the backup container to your machine

=== Backing up the Voila environment

A Voila environment is set with a version control system (git).

Each time you exit an activated Voila environment, it will commit its
changes and encrypt private information like:

* certificates in `./certs` folder
* `aporeto.yaml`

This means that if the Voila environment is *not* activated, you cannot
edit those files.

Once activated, the files are decrypted and you can edit them either
from the Voila shell, or from the machine that is mounting the Voila
environment.

The Voila environment *MUST* be saved as its your entry point to manage
Segment Console upgrades and operations.

The recommended way is to push the Voila environment to a git remote
repository like GitHub or GitLab. If you donâ€™t have a git remote
repository infrastructure, just make sure to backup the Voila
environment to a safe place each time you are done using it.
